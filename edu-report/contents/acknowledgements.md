# Acknowledgements

The work presented here exists due to the contributions of many people and grants from the National Science Foundation, Google, and edX. **[CITE? Is there a google grant number?]** Building an autograder would not be possible without BJC, Snap<em>!</em> and CS10, which have collectively been supported by hundreds of dedicated students and teachers over the past seven years.

In particular, a huge **Thank You** to the following people who helped make this possible. They have all been incredibly supportive over the past year in making this happen.

* Dan Garcia for being a mentor for the past five years
* Armando Fox for reviewing this work
* Brian Harvey and Jens MÃ¶nig for Snap<em>!</em>
* Max Dougherty, Tina Huang, Yifat Amir and Patrick O'Halloran for their incredible work on the autograder
* Lauren Mock for all the work on BJC and CS10!
* The CS10 staff for testing unproven technology and for dealing with additional student questions!
