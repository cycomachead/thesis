# {{ page.level }} Survey Feedback & Analysis

Along with the data we collected, we surveyed students at two points to get feedback about their use of the autograder. The first survey occurred during the CS10 midterm, shortly after students should have completed labs 11 and 12. The second survey was given along with the final exam, at the end of the semester.

The first question we asked students was whether they preferred online lab checkoffs or oral lab checkoffs.

When discussing with TAs this is almost the exact opposite of the results they initially expected. TAs (and instructors, including from other courses) expected almost all students to prefer using the autograder to getting checked off orally. (Ratios some staff suggested were 75/25, 80/20, 90/10 in favor of an autograder. While no one had exactly the same prediction, everyone we spoke to assumed >= 70% students would prefer an autograder.) This validates that we have done a pretty good job in designing and tweaking the oral lab checkoff system (which has evolved over the past few year), but also that students like talking to TAs and that students are not simply trying to beat the system. Instructional staff had concerns about students preferences, because many assumed that the autograder would be the path of least resistance for students. It's worth noting, however that part of the bias towards in-person over online checkoffs could very likely be attributed to bugs in the system early on, but this is still a promising result. (Many open-ended feedback comments mentioned bugs or glitches as a reason for the feelings about the autograder.)

Here is a sampling of comments students gave. Each of these comments is representative of feelings of other students.

> "It would save a lot of time during check off."


> "You get to talk to an actual person! If any questions remain, they can easily be answered!"


> "If I don't finish in class, I am more incentivized to finish it at home instead of at next lab."


> “It worked for me, but I guess doing manual lab check-off was better, in a way, because you get feedback from the TA.”


> “A heads-up would have been nice, as well as something explaining how to use it, but I like this feature a lot. When it works properly, it is very useful and helpful for my learning.”


> “I don't trust it.”


> “The autograde sometimes has bugs. For example, if my code is wrong but sometimes still reported the correct value, it would mark me as a pass.”

Many students preferred the higher fidelity of in person question asking and answering. What’s interesting is that autograded checkoffs wouldn’t prevent students from getting their questions answered. Many students remarked about different levels of stress which come from automated systems or humans. While students didn’t elaborate on *why* they would be more (or less) stressed with an autograder system, the most probable answer is that such a view is really a matter of personal preference. Many students do enjoy that (human) TAs are much more relaxed and comfortable to discuss questions and generally forgiving of errors. In contrast, the autograder (currently) can only provide static responses, and is very brittle when determining correctness. However, some students also noted that they’d prefer not to talk to a TA "unless absolutely necessary" and that they found the automated format easier to deal with. We think this is yet another demonstration that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ model isn't usually the best approach.

When we asked for general feedback about the tool, most of the comments were that it was confusing to use. This is understandable, because in retrospect there was not enough documentation nor TA trailing before the autograder was launched in class. Fortunately, this is a fairly easy problem to address for future semesters.

## {{ page.level }}.2 Final Survey Feedback

One promising result, is that we asked students for feedback on the overall use of lab checkoffs. While there is (not surprisingly) a large contingent of students who dislike the lab checkoffs, most of the students in support of checkoffs specifically asked for more autograder questions. 

When asked for feedback specific to the autograder, students seemed more positive than they did on the midterm survey. Of the students who had complaints, "bugs" and "glitches" were the biggest reasons. However, as with the midterm survey, there is a large number of students who are very strongly in favor of the opportunity to talk to TAs.

The final questions that we asked mostly backup the data that was collected.

So far these results confirm the data that's been collected. In the future, this suggests TAs can introduce the autograder to students as well as present the motivations for _how_ students should think about using it as a study tool.
