Over the course of three lab assignments, we found that students used the autograder to complete labs outside of course time. While we have no basis for when (or how often) students completed labs at home without the autograder, this shows that students are at least receiving the benefits of feedback when a TA is not present.

Secondly, when we surveyed students, they were almost evenly split between preferring oral lab checkoffs or the autograder. Given the lab setup, and the differing advantages for each environment, this is what we would hope for.

*Note*, unlike other educational studies, we are *not* trying to claim any learning gains from this system.
