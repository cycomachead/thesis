## Snap<em>!</em>
Snap<em>!</em> is inspired by MIT's Scratch {{ "scratch" | cite }}, but adapted for university-level courses by including features such as first-class lists and functions. Snap<em>!</em> is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language and implemented as a web application in Javascript.

## The Beauty and Joy of Computing
The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is an introduction to computing course designed to broaden participation among underrepresented groups. The primary language used is Snap<em>!</em>, and many of the exercises in the course have visual outputs. The course covers functions and abstraction, and also covers recursion, higher order functions (lambdas) and many other topics. Many of the examples and exercises in BJC have multiple paths to implementation, which can be a challenge for autograders to correctly handle.

## CS10
CS10 {{ "cs10" | cite }} is UC Berkeley's offering of BJC. Currently, CS10 is offered every semester to 200-300 students. Like many other introductory courses, CS10 relies heavily on laboratory sections as the primary method for students to learn to program. (However, programming is of course covered in lecture and discussion or 'recitation' sections.) Î» will be used in CS10 during lab sections to give students better feedback as they are working as well as to give credit for the assigned lab work. This year, we were able to trial the system for three of the 14 labs that students completed in Snap<em>!</em>.
