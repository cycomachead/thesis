# Introduction

In recent years, the field computer science (CS), and the broader technology industry, have undergone significant changes, though not simply technical ones. Around the same that same time from that enrollments started booming {{ "cra-blog" | cite }}, the National Science Foundation (NSF) posted the original solicitation for _Broadening Participation in Computing_ {{ "nsf-bpc" | cite }}. As a result of the efforts to improve diversity in CS, curricula such as _Exploring Computer Science_ {{ "ecs" | cite }} (ECS), and _AP Computer Science Principles_ {{ "apcsp" | cite }} (AP-CSP) have emerged. A central component of these new curricula includes the ability to use visual programming languages (VPLs) to teach CS. As great as these tools can be to teach programming, the often lack infrastructure found in more traditional environments (such as Python and Java). This lack on infrastructure can make courses more difficult to teach and scale. **[REF NEEDED?]** A critical example of missing infrastructure is the capability to automatically evaluate code, and send the results to another process. Automatic evaluation, and distributing the results are central components in an _autograder_. Without an autograder, it can be difficult (or simply costly) teach large online courses.

Î» is a system for autograding Snap<em>!</em> {{ "snap" | cite }}, a blocks-based programming language. Snap<em>!</em> is inspired by MIT's Scratch {{ "scratch" | cite }}, but adapted for university-level courses by including features such as first-class lists and functions.
